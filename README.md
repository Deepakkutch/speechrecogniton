# Minimum System Requirements

* Python 2.7
* speechrecognition
* moviepy
* rake-nltk

# Technologies used

Python

Tkinter

# Processes done so far

Conversion of structured and unstructured audio and video files using google speech recognition api.

Extraction of keywords from the output file using RAKE(Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm.

Main feature of selecting RAKE algorithm is that it is domain independent and can analyse the frequency of the word appreance and its 
co-occurance with other words in the text. 

# Future plan 

Extracting knowledge using the obtained keywords.
User can search any keywords and the program can deliver all the audio & video corresponding the
